 Actual Implementation of Scrapers/API Clients
While the research and planning are thorough, the actual implementation of the scrapers needs to be completed:

API clients for platforms with APIs (Meetup, Eventbrite)
Web scrapers for platforms without APIs (LinkedIn Events, Silicon Valley Forum, etc.)
Feed parsers for platforms with iCal/RSS feeds (Stanford/Berkeley Events)

Integration into a Unified System
Code to integrate the different data sources into a single, unified collection system.

3. Data Storage & Processing
Implementation of storage mechanisms and standardization of event data format across sources.

4. Error Handling & Rate Limiting
Proper implementation of the error handling and rate limiting strategies outlined in the documentation.

Recommended Next Steps
Create Base Classes/Interfaces:

Implement a common EventSource interface/base class
Develop specialized implementations for API, Scraping, and Feed-based sources
Implement Source-Specific Extractors:

Start with the easiest sources (those with APIs or feeds)
Implement web scrapers for the more challenging sources
Build Data Normalization Layer:

Create a standard event data model
Implement transformation logic for each source
Add Storage & Scheduling:

Implement database storage for collected events
Add scheduling capabilities to regularly update event data
Testing & Error Handling:

Implement comprehensive testing
Add robust error handling and logging
